### Imagery Assistance
Creating data around volcanoes has a few unique problems. Typically, there is a lack of clear, recent imagery. Due to cloud cover associated with volcanic activity, Bing (and other free tile services) do not often have acceptable resolution in our target areas. To solve this, we have worked with the USAID Geocenter and State Department's Humanitarian Information Unit (HIU) to host custom imagery. Both organizations have access to government purchased imagery (via Digital Globe), as well as the capacity to host and serve tiles.

### PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS

* <strong>State/HIU - Imagery to the Crowd (IttC): </strong> The HIU provides information to decision-makers and partners in preparation for and response to humanitarian emergencies worldwide and promotes innovative technologies and best practices for humanitarian information management. IttC publishes high-resolution commercial satellite imagery licensed by the United States Government, in a format that volunteers easily map into OpenStreetMap. IttC addresses significant data gaps for humanitarian and development needs. For more information, please visit their website, found [HERE](http://mapgive.state.gov/ittc/).

* <strong>USAID/Geocenter - Youth Mappers: </strong> YouthMappers is an international network of university student group chapters dedicated to mapping real-world challenges. YouthMappers is an activity of MappersU, a mapping for resilience international university consortium co-founded by Texas Tech University, George Washington University, West Virginia University, and the USAID GeoCenter. In 2015, the program formalized collaboration through a public launch and a four-year grant from the USAID GeoCenter.
