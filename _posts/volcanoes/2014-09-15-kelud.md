Kelud is an active stratovolcano located in East Java, Indonesia. Located on the Pacific Ring of Fire, Kelud is known for its frequent and large explosive eruptions. More than 30 eruptions have occurred since 1000 AD. The volcano last erupted on February 13, 2014, ejecting boulders, stones and ashes up to West Java about 300 miles away.  

It's estimated that this last eruption, and subsequent ash deposits, [caused billions of dollars in losses for Indonesia.](http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2014/02/17/kelud-causes-billions-losses.html)
